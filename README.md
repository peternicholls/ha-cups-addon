# CUPS Print Server - Home Assistant Addon

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpeternicholls%2Fha-cups-addon)

## Description

A CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) print server addon for Home Assistant, with printer drivers, USB support, AirPrint discovery, and a configurable web UI. Supports amd64, aarch64, armv7, armhf, and i386.

Tested with Home Assistant OS **17.1** and Home Assistant Core **2026.2**.

## Features

- **AirPrint support** - Printers are automatically discoverable by iOS and macOS devices via cups-browsed and Avahi mDNS
- **Sidebar landing page** - Clicking the addon in the HA sidebar shows a purpose-built page with a direct link to the CUPS web UI, a shortcut to addon settings, and useful documentation links
- **Configurable options** - Admin username, password, log level, and default paper size are all configurable from the addon settings
- **USB printer support** - Connect USB printers to the host before starting the addon
- **Driver packages** - Includes HP (HPLIP), Brother, Gutenprint, and other common printer drivers via cups-filters
- **Runtime user creation** - Admin user is created at startup from the addon configuration, not baked into the image
- **Logging to HA** - CUPS logs are written to stdout and visible in the Home Assistant log viewer

## Installation

1. Click the badge above to add this repository to your Home Assistant instance, or manually add `https://github.com/peternicholls/ha-cups-addon` in **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on store → Repositories**.
2. Install the **CUPS Print Server** addon.
3. Configure the options (see below).
4. Start the addon.
5. Open the web UI via the sidebar to add printers.

## Configuration

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `admin_user` | `print` | CUPS admin username |
| `admin_password` | `print` | CUPS admin password |
| `cups_log_level` | `warn` | Log verbosity: `warn`, `info`, or `debug` |
| `default_paper_size` | `A4` | Default paper size: `A4` or `Letter` |

It is recommended to change the default admin password before exposing the addon.

## Notes

- **USB printers** should be connected to the host before starting the addon. Reconnecting during runtime requires an addon restart.
- The **HA sidebar** shows a landing page rather than the CUPS interface directly — this is intentional. CUPS's authentication and redirect behaviour is not compatible with HA's ingress proxy, so the landing page provides a one-click link to open CUPS at `http://[your-ha-host]:631` instead.
- The **CUPS web UI** is accessible directly at `http://homeassistant.local:631` (or your HA host's IP). You must be on the same local network as your Home Assistant instance.
- AirPrint discovery relies on the addon being on the same network segment as your devices (host networking is enabled).

## Development

### s6-overlay script conventions

All executable scripts under `rootfs/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/` must follow two rules:

1. **Shebang**: use `#!/usr/bin/with-contenv bashio`. This injects the container environment variables (stored by s6 in `/var/run/s6/container_environment/`) into the process before execution. `#!/usr/bin/env bashio` does **not** do this.
2. **`exec` for longruns**: `run` scripts for `longrun` services must call their daemon with `exec` as the final command (e.g. `exec cupsd -f`). This replaces the bash process in-place so s6-supervise is attached to the daemon directly, ensuring correct signal delivery and restart behaviour.

Oneshot `up` files may use either a shebang script or a raw command (no shebang); both are valid s6-rc formats.
